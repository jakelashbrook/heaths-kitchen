## Site Summary 

Heaths Kitchen is a small cafe situated in Stockton Heath, Warrington. The business is adjusting to
the new realities for the hospitality industry in a world changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of
a long term plan to handle whatever the future brings, the cafe is rebranding itself from being named 
Heaths 26 to the more stylish sounding Heaths Kitchen. The company has used the same GUI generated site 
since it was formed nearly a decade ago. 

As part of the long term plan, we aim to build up a more attractive presence for the business online that 
will build on the familiarity the company has with its regular customers and try to reach out to new client
bases by initially expanding it's online services in the following areas: Online Table Reservations, Ordering Food Online to
collect, And being able to order cakes, buffets and Finger Foods for special events.
